Hibernate takes data in form of objects and stores in database.
It writes the sql query itself and developer does not have to do these work.
The configuration is done via hibernate config file.
Easiest way is to config via XML file. It consist of all the data.
The standard name of hibernate config file is hibernate.cfg.xml
Properties are dependent on the type of the database used in Applications.
Database table is similar to a class in Java. we have to match class with table.
Class is Entity and its Object is saved in database table accordingly.
We can use XML files and Annotations for the Hibernate framework. XML is not recommended.
Basic Annotations in Hibernate - Commonly used hibernate annotations
@Entity - use to mark class as Entity
@Table - use to change the table details
@Id - to mark a column as id(primary key - uniquely identify records in database)
@GeneratedValue - it will automatically generate the value of primary key. we have to apply strategies for this.
@Column - it is used to changed the column name and specify the mappings. If we want to modify column details.
@Transient - it tells hibernate not to save a particular field. If we want three columns out of four properties in class.
@Temporal - it is put over date fields and tells hibernate the format in which date needs to be saved.
@Lob - it tells hibernate that this is a large object, not a simple object
Advanced Annotations in Hibernate Framework.
@OneToOne
@OneToMany
@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn

Fetch Data - We have to methods for this operation that is get() and load() that can be used.
